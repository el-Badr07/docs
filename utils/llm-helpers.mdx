## Advanced Prompt Engineering

### Schema-Driven Prompt Generation

The LLM Helper system uses **sophisticated prompt engineering** techniques specifically designed for accounting document processing:

#### JSON Schema Enforcement
**Structured Output Guarantee**: Every LLM call includes detailed JSON schema specifications that ensure:
- Consistent data structure across all responses
- Required field validation at the AI level
- Type safety for financial amounts, dates, and enumerations
- Automatic retry with schema corrections when responses don't conform

#### Context-Aware Prompting
**Dynamic Prompt Assembly**: Prompts are dynamically constructed based on:
- Document type and complexity detected during initial analysis
- User language preferences and regional accounting standards
- Historical processing results for similar documents
- Current processing phase requirements and validation needs

#### Multi-Language Prompt Support
**Localized Processing**: The system maintains prompt templates in multiple languages:
- **French**: Primary language for French accounting compliance
- **English**: International business document processing
- **Arabic**: Regional business requirements and document types

### Prompt Optimization Strategies

#### Confidence-Based Prompt Refinement
**Adaptive Prompting**: When initial processing produces low-confidence results:
- Prompts are automatically refined with additional context
- Multiple prompt variations are tested to find optimal approaches
- Successful prompt patterns are cached for future use
- Failed approaches are logged to prevent repetition

#### Domain-Specific Prompt Libraries
**Specialized Templates**: Different prompt templates optimized for:
- **Invoice Extraction**: Focused on financial data, dates, and vendor information
- **Account Mapping**: Emphasizing PCG compliance and business logic
- **Journal Generation**: Ensuring double-entry accounting principles
- **Validation**: Focused on error detection and compliance checking

## Response Processing and Validation

### Multi-Layer Validation System

#### Immediate Response Validation
**Real-Time Checking**: Every LLM response undergoes immediate validation:
- **JSON Structure**: Verification that responses conform to expected schema
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensuring amounts are numeric, dates are properly formatted
- **Business Logic**: Checking that VAT calculations are mathematically correct
- **Completeness**: Verifying all required fields are present and populated

#### Confidence Scoring Integration
**Quality Assessment**: Each processed response receives comprehensive confidence scoring:
- **Extraction Completeness**: Percentage of expected fields successfully extracted
- **Format Consistency**: How well extracted data matches expected patterns
- **Cross-Validation**: Consistency between different parts of the extracted data
- **Historical Comparison**: How similar the results are to previously validated documents

#### Automatic Retry Logic
**Smart Recovery**: When responses fail validation:
- **Immediate Retry**: Simple formatting issues trigger immediate retry with refined prompts
- **Provider Switching**: Persistent failures trigger automatic provider switching
- **Escalation**: Complex failures are escalated to human review with full context
- **Learning Integration**: Failed patterns are analyzed to improve future processing

### Caching and Performance Optimization

#### Intelligent Response Caching
**Content-Based Caching**: The system implements sophisticated caching strategies:
- **Content Hashing**: Identical document content gets cached responses regardless of filename
- **Partial Matching**: Similar documents leverage cached components where appropriate
- **Provider-Specific**: Caches are maintained separately for each AI provider
- **TTL Management**: Cache expiration balances freshness with performance

#### Cost Optimization
**Token Usage Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of AI provider costs:
- **Per-Document Tracking**: Cost attribution for each processed invoice
- **Provider Comparison**: Analysis of cost-effectiveness across different providers
- **Usage Optimization**: Identification of opportunities to reduce token consumption
- **Budget Management**: Automatic cost controls and alerts
